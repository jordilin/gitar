# Installation

<!-- toc -->

There are multiple ways to install gitar. The easiest would be to go to the
gitar releases page at <https://github.com/jordilin/gitar/releases> and download the tarball for your platform.

## Linux

Download the tar.gz file that is built using musl libc. This should work on
all linux distributions as it provides a static binary with no platform dependencies.

For example, in the last release `v0.1.62` we could download
`https://github.com/jordilin/gitar/releases/download/v0.1.62/gr-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`,
that would correspond for a Linux x86_64 machine.

## MacOS

Similarly, for MacOS, download the tar.gz file that corresponds to your CPU
architecture and is built for Darwin. The last release `v0.1.62` for a Mac
computer with the M processor would be
`https://github.com/jordilin/gitar/releases/download/v0.1.62/gr-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
and for an Intel one would be
`https://github.com/jordilin/gitar/releases/download/v0.1.62/gr-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
